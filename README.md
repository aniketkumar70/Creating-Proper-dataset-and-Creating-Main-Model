This AI project helps doctors diagnose cancer by using YOLOv8 to automatically find cancer cells in microscopic images.



## Requirements

To run this model, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- os
- shutil
- ultralytics
- zipfile

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib ultralytics
```

## Additional Information

- The segmentation model is based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, which is known for its efficiency in real-time object detection.
- Input images should be pre-processed and formatted according to the model's requirements.
- Outputs will be generated in the specified output directory.
